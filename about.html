                <h2 class="title-1 drop-in" id="title1">About Me</h2>
                <p class="p-about drop-in" id="about-1">Hi there! I'm Ciara Stafford, a passionate software engineer with a background as a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) and now a dedicated single mom to a wonderful toddler. My journey into the world of technology has been a dynamic one, driven by my insatiable curiosity and love for problem-solving.</p>
                <h3 class="title-2 drop-in" id="title2">Professional Background</h3>
                <p class="p-about drop-in" id="about-2">My career in technology began with a transition from behavioral therapy to software engineering. Prior to diving into coding, I worked as a Registered Behavior Technician, where I developed invaluable skills in empathy, patience, and understanding human behavior. This experience laid a strong foundation for my journey into the tech industry, where I've found a new outlet for my passion for helping others through technology solutions.</p>
                <p class="p-about drop-in" id="about-3">With over a year of experience in the fintech sector, I've had the privilege of working on cutting-edge projects that have a real impact on people's lives. My role has exposed me to a wide range of technologies and methodologies, allowing me to continuously expand my skill set and adapt to new challenges.</p>
                <h3 class="title-1 drop-in" id="title3">Journey into Tech</h3>
                <p class="p-about drop-in" id="about-4">My fascination with technology and desire to make a difference led me to explore coding bootcamps. I immersed myself in intensive learning, soaking up everything from front-end development to full-stack architecture. It was a challenging yet incredibly rewarding experience, and it paved the way for my successful transition into the tech industry.</p>

                <h3 class="title-1 drop-in" id="title4">Passion for Front-End and Full-Stack</h3>
                <p class="p-about drop-in" id="about-5">While I have a special affinity for front-end development, I'm equally enthusiastic about diving into the intricacies of full-stack development. I thrive on the creativity and visual appeal of front-end design, but I also enjoy the problem-solving aspect of building robust back-end systems. My goal is to create seamless user experiences by bridging the gap between design and functionality.</p>
                <h3 class="title-1 drop-in" id="title5">What Drives Me</h3>
                <p class="p-about drop-in" id="about-6">As a single mom, my toddler is my greatest motivation. Every line of code I write and every project I tackle is fueled by the desire to create a better future for us both. I'm driven by the belief that technology has the power to transform lives, and I'm committed to leveraging my skills to make a positive impact on the world around me.</p>
